 cms_the_three_keys_desc: "Couto Misto is a union of the three vilages of Santiago, Rubiás and Meaus. Due to complicated manorial legalities we do not formally belong to any noble, king or clergym, instead the people of Couto Misto rule by themselves and elect a Juiz to serve as the leader and coordinate the necessaties of the three vilages and its peasantry. This judge is granted by the leaders of each village the three keys of our nation, granting him the legitimacy, trust and right to rule by the people and for the people."

 cms_freedom_from_tribute_desc: "Our defacto independence has given our people a variety of rights and priveleges that peasants in other neighboring realms can only dream of. Perhaps the most important of these is the right to be free from tribute or in other words, taxes. Our people do not pay any taxes, fees or any other sort of monetary restriction that is common in neighboring realms. This gives our peasantry an unheard of level of security and happyness, and altough it has meant the state has less resources to improve itself our people are no strangers to helping a friend and neighbor in need."

We shall not forego our freedoms, if there need be the bells of Couto Misto shall ring and every peasant will muster and stand ready to defend our homes and families."

 cms_caminho_priveligiado_desc: "The kingdoms are not blind to our prosperity and they have given us a unique offer. They offer us the priveleged ways: access to their city markets to sell our goods with no extra added taxes or tariffs. Some village leaders say this is but early stages of attempted economic dominance but our Judge disagrees, we shall make use of the priveleged ways and share our fortune with our fellow peasant and perhaps find a way to sway them to liberty."

 cms_a_mixed_society_desc: "Our villages are made up of a combination of Galician, Portuguese and even Leonese and Castilian peasants but even as we may all come from different cultures and regions, we all known we are peasants first and foremost. In the end, our love for freedom and liberty unites us and holds us together against the tyranny of the world."

 cms_to_live_in_peace_desc: "We have come far. We have set up our new homes and villages in this foreign land, we have come here in search of freedom and liberty and found it already claimed by others. It would be easy to turn to the sword or musket but it would not be right. We can, no, we must live in peace together. We could not defend or protect the abused of the old world but with all our might we shall defend the abused of the new one."

A land where anyone can be free and live life how they choose to. A land open to all cultures and races of man, a land free for all peasants of the world. The world may change, they may embrace tyranny and despots but all the opressed of the world may rest easy to known they will always be welcome here."
