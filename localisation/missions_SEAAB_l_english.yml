 #Srivijaya Missions#
 build_up_navy_mission_title:0 "Rebuild the Royal Navy"
 build_up_navy_mission_desc:0 "The Srivijayan Navy has been in disrepair since the end of the Malaya revolt. The war was a disaster for our ships, as the Orang Laut joined forces with the Malay Sultanates, adding their pirate junks to the fray. In the Battle of the Straits in 1362, we lost over 1/3rd of our navy and hundreds of good sailors. It is time to rebuild, recruit, and prepare to retake control of the seas!"

 prepare_for_expansion_srivijaya_desc:0 "With the profits from trade now trickling in, it is time to expand the harbors. While the capital's growth has been staggering over the last hundred years, its harbors remain stagnant and old, and thus, renovation is needed; Cirebon, the administrative head of the island of Java, has also seen a wild growth in population, and is another prime target for this wave building expansions, especially in the shipyards of the coastal city. Soon, we shall have the capacity to build ships large enough to not only counter our enemies, but also to possibly follow the dream of exploring the far eastern isles..."

A warm, humid land to the south of Papua, which has a coastline that spreads even further south. It might be within our best interests to explore these southern lands, and even set up a few colonies in the region."
