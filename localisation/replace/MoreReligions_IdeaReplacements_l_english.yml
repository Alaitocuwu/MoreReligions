 jap_unification_under_the_emperor: "The Kenmu Restoration"
 jap_unification_under_the_emperor_desc: "In the aftermath of the fall of the Kamakura Shogunate at the hands of the Nitta Yoshisada and emperor Go-Daigo, the country had finally, after nearly 200 years of military rule, fallen back into the emperor's control. The emperor is the sovereign of all the islands of Japan, and despite the attempts by various clans and samurai to overthrow him, the house of Yamato stands strong against all pretenders."
 reformed_land_holding: "Go-Kameyama Reforms"
 reformed_land_holding_desc: "At the turn of the 15th Century, emperor Go-Daigo's dreams of reforming the land distribution systems of Japan were still far off from being completed. He wished to pull control away from the Shugo, centralizing authority from within the state as was the case in the Chen-Han Dynasty to the west. However, this dream would not be seen until the rise of emperor Go-Kameyama, who secured an alliance with the Nitta clan through a marriage and pushed through his reforms at a national level. Now, the Emperor can not only rule the land more effectively, but he may also quickly summon his soldiers from their homes should the need arise."
 jap_modernization: "Cheng–Zhu Teachings"
 jap_modernization_desc: "Neo-Confucianism teaches a rationalist, academic truth to the world, that one must explore the world in an observationalist way. While it initially remained within the mountain temples during the Kamakura era, emperor Go-Murakami was the first to incorporate aspects of this school into the governance of the country. He encouraged learning, reasoning, and scientific advancements through various places of learning which he sponsored and patroned, such as the Ashikaga Gakko."
 jap_land_of_the_rising_sun: "Shinbutsu-Shugo"
 jap_land_of_the_rising_sun_desc: "Japan is a land of Kami and Buddhas, of monks and priests, of temples and shrines. The Buddhist traditions that arose and developed here have intermingled and conjoined with the native traditions of the Kami, tying our past with our ever developing future. While the two are not always perfectly aligned, the people of Japan follow both the path of the dharma and the worship of nature."
 jap_shogun_legacy: "Legacy of the Shogunate"
 jap_shogun_legacy_desc: "While the shogun was defeated and pushed away, the samurai still remain a powerful force in our political climate. We cannot simply ignore them; we shall do as Go-Daigo did, and work to integrate them to become loyal subjects once more. They are, after all, incredibly wise and talented warriors, so it would only make sense to conjoin them with our state."
